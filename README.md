# Known bugs and limitations
- when blind mode is turned off, the final value is applied regardless of the fader position. waiting for feedback before changing that.
- plugging / unplugging Midi devices while the application is running might lead to wrong information display in the input list.
- the app does not filter the midi messages source. use different CC ids accros multiple controllers if needed.
