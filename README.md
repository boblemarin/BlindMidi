# Known bugs and limitations
- When blind mode is turned off, the final value is applied regardless of the fader position. waiting for feedback before changing that.
- The app does not filter the midi messages source. use different CC ids accros multiple controllers if needed.
- Plugging / unplugging Midi devices while the application is running might lead to wrong information displayed in the input list.
- And many more...
